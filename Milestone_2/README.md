###Sasha Azad 
Garden Theme : A dungeon 
The dungeon is filled with crates and archways that lead to the outer and lower levels. Some boxes seem to have bodies in them, as they scream in pain as they're pushed around. You can hear bones breaking if excess force is used to rush at the boxes. The wind whistles through the floor grate at the entry level, but this quickly gives way to the machine grinding sounds of the level. The character rushes about, trying to get out of the level.
