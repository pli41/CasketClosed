#Casket Closed Milestone 2 Readme

Group Objectives Completed:
- NPC has ragdoll physics: when the player depossesses the NPC by pressing space, the capsule collider is turned off, and the ragdoll coliders & rigid bodies are activated
- The capsule collider changes size as the character transitions from running to walking to idle. Press and hold left shift to run while walking forward.
- Game Feel Target:
	Our target is a deliberate, impatient man. He walks with force, so his rigid body has high mass so he knocks light objects like chairs and lamps out of the way. He doesn't walk too fast, but he'll sprint when he has to. In Scene 1, the "room_for_wake" explore how the npc can push around the furniture by walking the ghost over, pressing space, and walking around the room. Also, we have set up this scene so that the ghost cannot manipulate the furniture but the NPC can.

- Open Room_for_wake first

Theme/Biome: Forest river
Keypress for scene: 2
Press arrow keys or WASD to walk, space to possess, space again to depossess. The Ghost in my scene makes no sound: only human NPC's have footsteps. There are three types of steps: a splahy step for water, a squish step for the river bank, and a grassy step for the rest of the terrain. Directly in front of your starting position is a small crane and a long table, the crane is rigged so that the hook can swing, and the base can rotate. To the right, on the other side of the river, is a small camp with a swinging pot over a fire pit and several crates. Walk into any of these with the NPC to move them. The river is "advancedwater4" fro mthe standard assets, the waterfall and trees are from the asset store, the crates, bench, fire pit (not the particle effects, those are me), swinging pot are from the medieval asset pack. The crane is from a Linda tutorial.  The river has several audio sources along it with rushing water, the waterfall has a water fall audio source, and the detail grass waves in the wind.

Theme/Biome: Snow
Keypress for scene: 4
Press arrow keys to walk forward, back left and right in the snow. The player is a ghost that walks slow and creates different footstep sounds when walking on snow and the wooden plane present in the scene. It makes a sliding sound when it pushes crates around in the scene. It makes a grunt when it collides with the tank and the barbed wires in the scene. The tank and the windmills are the two compound objects. Note about buggy audio- it only plays when a collision with the player is detected. Also, the volume of the “walking on wood” audio is significantly lower than that of other sounds. As far as game feel goes, the level is an isolated/abandoned site which looks like it was once a military camp. Wind is blowing in the background. The ghost can interact with various objects in the scene and explore the region. It will discover that it can’t pass through the barbed wires and get hurt if trying to do so, but can go inside the military camp. All 3-D models from the scene were acquired from the Unity Asset Store.

While running the game, open the “Room_for_Wake” scene first and press other number keys to go to other scenes.
