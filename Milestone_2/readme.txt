Theme/Biome: Snow
Keypress for scene: 4
Press arrow keys to walk forward, back left and right in the snow. The player is a ghost that walks slow and creates different footstep sounds when walking on snow and the wooden plane present in the scene. It makes a sliding sound when it pushes crates around in the scene. It makes a grunt when it collides with the tank and the barbed wires in the scene. The tank and the windmills are the two compound objects. Note about buggy audio- it only plays when a collision with the player is detected. Also, the volume of the “walking on wood” audio is significantly lower than that of other sounds. As far as game feel goes, the level is an isolated/abandoned site which looks like it was once a military camp. Wind is blowing in the background. The ghost can interact with various objects in the scene and explore the region. It will discover that it can’t pass through the barbed wires and get hurt if trying to do so, but can go inside the military camp. All 3-D models from the scene were acquired from the Unity Asset Store.

While running the game, open the “Room_for_Wake” scene first and press other number keys to go to other scenes.
